Projects
========

Here are some of my Macintosh projects:

* [Trouble in Paradise] - A port of GRC's "TIP: Zip & Jaz Drive and Cartridge Testing System" for 68k and PowerPC Macintosh systems.
* [ScreenChooser] - A dynamic background changer for vintage Macintoshes.
* [Retroweb Vintage Computer Museum] - A web-based museum of vintage computers, including the Macintosh.

Resources

Interesting resources I have found on the web:

* [Thomas Tempelmann]'s Macintosh developer site.
* [Joshua Stein]'s Macintosh programming site
* [Apple Developer Resources Mirror]: Tons of resources formerly available via the Apple FTP site
* [CDEV Framework for Code Warrior]: A few CDEV projects with very good documentation
* [Mirror of UMICH resources]: A mirror of UMICH resources [UMICH mirror 1], [UMICH mirror 2] and [UMICH mirror 3]
  * [UMICH mirror 1] - This is the link via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. Consider clicking the "Save this URL" button for any things you find interesting and that the Internet Archive has not captured.
